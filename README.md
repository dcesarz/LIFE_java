# LIFE_java
Basic game of life java window app. 
The plan is to include at least 3 organisms, and for them to go into "action" with each other when they collide.
So far I have basic skeleton of the app, the organisms can now spawn and only move within bounds of the frame.
The organisms will have different colors for user to tell them apart.
The window has a set dimension.
It uses triple buffer strategy for the sake of fluidity.
